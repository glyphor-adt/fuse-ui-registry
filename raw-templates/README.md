# Raw Templates

This directory contains unmodified source templates that serve as read-only reference sources.

## Purpose

The `raw-templates/` folder is a holding area for original, unmodified template files. These templates should remain unchanged and serve as the authoritative source for template work.

## Structure

Each template has its own subfolder:
- `raw-templates/agenforce-marketing/` - Agenforce Marketing template
- (Additional templates will be added here)

## Usage

**Important:** Files in this directory are read-only references. Do not refactor or normalize files here.

All future template work must:
1. Copy templates from `raw-templates/` 
2. Place them into `packages/template-kits/`
3. Perform any necessary modifications in the `packages/template-kits/` location

## Guidelines

- ✅ Keep original template files unmodified
- ✅ Preserve original structure and formatting
- ✅ Use as reference source for copying
- ❌ Do not refactor files in this directory
- ❌ Do not normalize files in this directory
- ❌ Do not modify original templates
